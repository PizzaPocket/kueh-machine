extends RefCounted

## Builds an entire humanoid figure from scratch out of SuperEgg body
## segments, per direct instruction -- replacing the earlier imported-GLB
## rig (figure.glb for the player, the Kenney prototype-kit figurine
## variants for NPCs) for both.
##
## Spine: hips (root) -> abdomen -> chest, each a torso SuperEgg with flat
## top/bottom seams (SuperEgg.EPSILON_FLAT) so they read as distinct
## stacked segments rather than blending into one blob -- flat faces mate
## flush against each other with no gap, unlike two rounded caps meeting
## at a point (see below). Chest is the widest, abdomen narrower, hips a
## bit wider than the abdomen but shorter, per spec.
##
## Limb segments (upper/lower arm and leg, hands, feet) use a symmetric
## soft-rounded profile instead (SuperEgg.EPSILON_SOFT both ends), which
## DOES pinch to a point at each pole -- two such segments just touching
## at a shared joint point reads as a visible pinch/gap right at the
## joint, which is exactly why an earlier version filled that gap with a
## small sphere at each joint. Per direct instruction those spheres are
## gone now (joints should be plain pivot points, not their own visible
## segment); most joints instead use _build_overlapping_segment(), which
## renders a segment slightly longer than its *logical* length and shifts
## it so the extra length overlaps into its neighbor, burying the pinch in
## the overlap (JOINT_OVERLAP for ordinary joints; HIP_SOCKET_EMBED is
## deliberately much larger for the hip, so the thigh visibly pokes up
## into the hip volume like a real ball-and-socket, not just avoiding a
## pinch). The shoulder is the one deliberate exception -- per direct
## instruction the upper arm attaches to the *outside* of the chest with
## no overlap treatment, and the resulting pinch there is fine.
##
## No ancestor-rotation correction anywhere here (contrast the old
## figure.glb/npc.gd rig, which needed a static 180-degree turn to fix an
## imported model's reversed native front) -- every part is built directly
## in this project's own "+Z is forward" convention, since there's no
## external asset in the chain with a conflicting one of its own.
##
## build() returns the pivots player.gd/npc.gd need for animation:
## head/arm_left/arm_right/leg_left/leg_right (rotating one of these
## swings that whole limb from the shoulder/hip, as before) plus
## elbow_left/elbow_right/knee_left/knee_right (rotating one of these
## bends just the forearm/hand or shin/foot, for the walk cycle's subtle
## knee/elbow articulation -- see player.gd/npc.gd's _animate_walk),
## ankle_left/ankle_right (rotating one of these tips just the foot,
## unused by the ordinary walk cycle but needed for player.gd's jump/
## landing pose), spine (the abdomen/chest/head/arms all hang off this,
## but NOT the legs -- rotating it leans the upper body forward while
## walking, the way a real person's spine does, without tilting the legs
## too), and hips (the pelvis mesh itself -- rotating its Z tilts it
## side-to-side, e.g. for an idle "weight on one leg" pose's hip drop; see
## player.gd/npc.gd's idle-pose comments). Also hand_left/hand_right (the
## hand's own built MeshInstance3D) and palm_left/palm_right/back_left/
## back_right (plain Node3Ds sitting on the hand's own palm- and
## back-facing surfaces respectively, each a child of `hand` so it inherits
## the hand's wrist twist automatically -- see _build_arm's own PalmAttach/
## BackAttach comments for the confirmed-by-observation derivation of which
## side is which). player.gd parents the held-item visual to the palm
## point specifically, so it actually rests against the palm surface
## rather than being centered inside the hand volume or hung off an
## independently-guessed shoulder offset; back_left/back_right exist for
## future pose/animation work that needs to reason about the back of the
## hand specifically. Also wrist_left/wrist_right and fingertip_left/
## fingertip_right (plain Node3Ds at the hand segment's own true logical
## boundaries along its length axis -- see _build_arm's own WristAttach/
## FingertipAttach comment for why hand's own origin is neither of those),
## and toe_left/toe_right (a plain Node3D at the
## foot's own true forward tip -- see _build_leg's own ToeAttach comment
## for the derivation -- a child of `foot` so it inherits both the foot's
## position offset and its toe-out yaw automatically), which
## blorb_suit.gd's own leg noodle routes through directly (hip -> knee ->
## ankle -> toe) instead of approximating the tip's position by hand.

# never the problem -- it stays at the original symmetric depth. Since a
# SuperEgg's z is a half-depth around its own local Z=0, an asymmetric

## Uniform scale-up applied to the whole short-sleeve cap (all of x/y/z)

## body parts.

## Shifts the whole short-sleeve cap straight down by this much, per a
## further direct instruction ("lower it by one cm") -- applied AFTER the

## edges move down together, size unchanged), not a re-anchoring of any
## earlier step.
const SLEEVE_LOWER := 0.01
## How far past its current (lowered) bottom edge a short sleeve's BOTTOM
## extends, per a further direct instruction ("extend the bottom by 6cm")
## -- same asymmetric extra-length-on-one-end treatment SLEEVE_TOP_EXTEND
## uses, mirrored to the bottom: only the bottom edge moves (down by this
## amount), the top edge stays exactly where the prior steps left it.
## Originally 0.06 (6cm); a later direct instruction ("raise the bottom
## edge back up by 3cm") pulled it back in by 3cm, net 0.03 -- since
## raising the bottom edge by R is mathematically the exact same
## half_height/position adjustment as this constant itself, just with the
## opposite sign, that correction was folded directly into this single
## constant (0.06 - 0.03 = 0.03) rather than kept as a second, separate

## 3.0). Lower epsilon reads as rounder (see this file's own class doc:
## epsilon near 2 traces a plain ellipse; higher values bow the profile out
## toward the corners, boxier), so this is BELOW EPSILON_SOFT -- same 2.5
## value HEAD_EPSILON_TOP already uses for the same "more curved than the

## own epsilon-direction warning (below 2 pinches into a star shape
## instead of rounding further).
const SLEEVE_TOP_EPSILON := 2.5
## How sharp the short sleeve's BOTTOM hem is, per a further direct
## instruction ("make the bottom edge even sharper") -- above
## EPSILON_FLAT (5.5, the "boxy" value used for torso seams elsewhere in
## this file), since epsilon has no real ceiling: it keeps bowing the
## profile further out toward the corners as it rises, asymptotically
## approaching a perfectly flat-topped cylinder (a hard 90-degree edge) as
## epsilon -> infinity. 9.0 is just a further step in that same direction,
## not a limit being hit -- raise it more if the hem should read sharper
## still.

## skin_color/scale let town_generator.gd give NPCs some visual variety

## the arms are skin_color instead, like bare arms, with SLEEVE_STYLE_SHORT
## additionally adding a shirt_color sleeve cap mesh over just the top half
## of the upper arm); pants_color covers the hips and legs. shoe_color is
## optional and defaults to pants_color, preserving the uniform trouser-and-
## shoe look for callers that do not specify it. Both clothing colors default
## to skin_color, which reads as no clothing at all (a uniform-toned figure).
##
## chest_build_scale/hip_build_scale/abdomen_width_scale vary body WIDTH/
## DEPTH only (never height -- the vertical stacking below is computed
## from the unscaled *_SIZE consts' own .y components throughout, so these
## never disturb where anything ends up standing) -- per direct
## instruction, everyone defaulted to the same skinny build.
## abdomen_width_scale gets a much wider range than the other two
## deliberately: 1.0 (this file's own base ABDOMEN_SIZE) is the *narrow*
## end of the range, never scaled down further, broadening up from there;
## chest_build_scale/hip_build_scale are each a smaller, subtler variation
## around 1.0 in both directions. The actual ranges live in
## town_generator.gd's NPC_*_BUILD_SCALES/NPC_ABDOMEN_WIDTH_SCALES; all
## three simply default to 1.0 (this file's base proportions) for any
## caller -- e.g. the player -- that doesn't care about this.
##
## chest_build_scale and hip_build_scale are deliberately SEPARATE knobs
## (an earlier version used one shared build_scale for both), per direct
## instruction: chest broadness and hip broadness need to vary
## independently (e.g. broad chests only for some NPCs, wider hips only
## for others) rather than always moving together. Leg width always
## tracks hip_build_scale specifically (not its own independent scale, and
## not chest_build_scale) -- per direct instruction, "the width of the
## upper leg nodes should correspond to the width of the hip segment
## always." Arm width tracks chest_build_scale instead, which was already
## implicitly true before this split (arms hang off the shoulder/chest).

## Short-sleeve cap mesh for sleeve_style == SLEEVE_STYLE_SHORT, a child of
## arm_pivot alongside (not replacing) the bare-skin upper arm segment
## _build_arm already built just above this call. Base shape per direct
## instruction: half the upper arm's own logical length, wider than the arm
## by SLEEVE_OFFSET on both x/z, round on top to match the arm's own
## SuperEgg roundness, flat-edged on the bottom -- then reshaped by four
## further direct instructions applied in order below: top extended by
## SLEEVE_TOP_EXTEND, whole cap enlarged by SLEEVE_ENLARGE_SCALE, whole cap
## lowered by SLEEVE_LOWER, bottom extended by SLEEVE_BOTTOM_EXTEND. Order
## matters -- each step below acts on whatever the previous step left
## behind, not on the original base shape.
##
## Length: upper_arm_size.y is the arm's own HALF-length (every *_SIZE
## const in this file is a half-extent, per SuperEgg's semi_axes
## convention), so the arm's full logical length is upper_arm_size.y * 2
## and half of that is upper_arm_size.y -- the sleeve's own base FULL
## length before any of the steps below, i.e. sleeve_half_height =
## upper_arm_size.y * 0.5.
##
## Base position: sits flush against the shoulder, i.e. from arm_pivot's
## own y=0 (the same top the upper arm segment itself starts from)
## downward. No overlap treatment the way _build_overlapping_segment gives
## ordinary joints -- the shoulder already accepts a visible pinch by
## design (see this file's own class doc), and this mesh's bottom edge is
## a deliberate flat hem to show, not a pinch to bury in overlap.
##
## 1. Top extend: SLEEVE_TOP_EXTEND is added to the render half-height and
## the center shifted up by half that amount -- the same asymmetric-extent
## math _build_overlapping_segment uses (extra_top only, extra_bottom=0),
## worked out by hand here since that helper doesn't expose per-end
## epsilon. Moves ONLY the top edge (up past the shoulder); the bottom hem
## stays exactly where the base shape put it.
##
## 2. Enlarge: SLEEVE_ENLARGE_SCALE multiplies the resulting size (x, the
## extended half-height, and z) uniformly, position unchanged -- grows the
## whole cap symmetrically around its own (already top-extended) center, so
## this step moves BOTH edges outward again, on top of the top-only move
## in step 1.
##
## 3. Lower: SLEEVE_LOWER subtracts from the center position directly, size
## unchanged -- shifts the already-enlarged cap straight down as a rigid
## whole (both edges move down together by the same amount).
##
## 4. Bottom extend: SLEEVE_BOTTOM_EXTEND is added to the half-height and
## the center shifted DOWN by half that amount -- the mirror-image of step
## 1's math, extra length on the bottom end instead of the top. Moves ONLY
## the bottom edge (further down); the top edge stays exactly where steps
## 1-3 left it.
##
## Roundness: epsilon_top uses SLEEVE_TOP_EPSILON -- originally matched the
## upper arm segment's own top (SuperEgg's default EPSILON_SOFT) per direct
## instruction, but a later direct instruction ("make the top side
## rounder") deliberately broke that match; see SLEEVE_TOP_EPSILON's own
## comment. epsilon_bottom uses SLEEVE_BOTTOM_EPSILON for the flat hem --
## started at EPSILON_FLAT (5.5, the general torso-seam flat value) per
## direct instruction, then raised further per a later direct instruction
## ("make the bottom edge even sharper"); see SLEEVE_BOTTOM_EPSILON's own
## comment for why that's a dial, not a hard limit.
