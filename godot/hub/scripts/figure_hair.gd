extends RefCounted

## Procedural hairstyles for the superegg head (see procedural_figure.gd).
## Every style shares the technique tuned for the original (and still
## default) BUZZCUT: one or more superegg pieces positioned via FOUR EDGES
## (front/back/top/bottom -- each a signed distance from the head's own
## center along that axis) rather than a center offset + half-extent, since
## tuning requests have consistently come in edge-at-a-time ("bring the
## front forward, leave the back alone"). _center()/_half_extent() convert
## an edge pair back to what SuperEgg.build_mesh() actually needs.
##
## Per direct instruction, every style keeps the SAME front edge (the
## hairline) as the buzzcut -- only the buzzcut's sides/back/top/bottom
## vary per style (_buzzcut_edges() is the shared starting point every
## other style builds from), so switching styles never moves the hairline
## relative to the face.
##
## Styles are picked by a plain String constant (STYLE_*), not a Godot
## enum -- this project doesn't use enums elsewhere (VILLAGER_IDENTITIES,
## SHOP_STALL_POSITIONS etc. are all String-keyed), and a String sidesteps
## any cross-file enum-type-annotation uncertainty for an @export field on
## npc.gd that a real enum would carry.

## semi_axes.x is not edge-tuned per-side for the buzzcut baseline -- no

## Per direct correction: matching the head's own epsilon 1:1 (an earlier
## pass) still didn't read as round enough once the buzzcut's semi_axes
## were no longer close to spherical. Expressed as a RATIO applied to
## whatever epsilon the caller's head actually uses, not a hardcoded
## absolute hair epsilon -- so it keeps working the same way if NPCs ever
## get their own varying head epsilon, always landing the hair rounder
## than that particular head by the same proportion.
const HAIR_EPSILON_RATIO := 0.8

const BOTTOM_EPSILON_TARGET := SuperEgg.EPSILON_FLAT
## Per two direct corrections ("split the difference", then "a bit
## rounder, splitting the difference again to where it started"): 0.5

## current tuned value.
const BOTTOM_EPSILON_BLEND := 0.25

## AFRO: "extend the sides, top and back" -- kept fully round (bottom
## epsilon = top epsilon, no boxy blend at all) since an afro doesn't have
## a trimmed/clipped edge anywhere, unlike the buzzcut. Per a further
## direct correction ("extend more to the back and also extend downwards
## a bit" -- width judged already good, left alone): AFRO_BACK_EXTRA
## raised 0.05 -> 0.09, and AFRO_BOTTOM_EXTRA added. Per a still further
## direct correction ("doesn't need to be quite so wide, just by a cm or
## 2"): AFRO_WIDTH_REDUCTION added, a flat cm-scale trim applied after the
## multiplier (not a change to AFRO_WIDTH_MULT itself, which was judged

## FLAT_TOP: "extend the top upwards and make it less round" -- only the
## top changes (edge extended AND its own epsilon overridden boxy); sides/
## back/bottom stay at the buzzcut's own values, including the buzzcut's
## own mild boxy-bottom blend. Per a further direct correction ("shift the
## whole hair piece backwards 1cm, the hairline is too close to the
## face"): FRONT and BACK both shift back by the same amount -- a pure
## translation, not a resize, so the piece's own depth stays unchanged and
## only its position moves.

## BUN: "using the baseline buzzcut but adding a bun in the back top of
## it" -- the buzzcut is built unmodified, then this small extra round
## piece is added on top, positioned as a fraction of the buzzcut's own
## top/back edges so it nestles into the back-top of the existing mass
## rather than floating off on its own. Per a further direct correction
## ("a bit bigger and a bit farther back/down"): RADIUS_FACTOR up
## (0.35 -> 0.45), Z_FRACTION up (0.55 -> 0.7, farther back), Y_FRACTION
## down (0.8 -> 0.72, farther down -- "slightly", a smaller move than the
## other two).

## PONYTAIL: buzzcut base (see add_hair()'s own match) plus a tapered pipe
## emerging from the back of the head, built along a curved centerline via
## _build_tapered_tube() (see that function's own comment for why a curved
## single mesh is the right tool here, over either a straight primitive or
## several joined ones). Per direct correction, re-described more
## precisely: the centerline is a true S-curve (a cubic Bezier, which can
## actually hold an inflection point -- an earlier quadratic version could
## only ever bow one direction, not cross back the other way like a real
## S). Reading down the curve: it first reaches decisively rearward with
## very little drop so the thick body clears the head mesh, then swings toward the
## opposite lean around the midpoint (PONYTAIL_S_P2_FORWARD_FRACTION,
## the S's own cross), then finishes rearward of the hanging body.
##
## The RADIUS profile is independent of the curve shape: per direct
## correction, only the start and end taper (smoothly, via smoothstep,
## down to a true point at t=0 and t=1) while the bulk of the body holds
## one CONSTANT radius -- a capsule-like profile, not the single continuous
## cone an earlier version used.

const PONYTAIL_TAPER_OUT_FRACTION := 0.20
## The S-curve's own two control points, expressed as fractions of
## PONYTAIL_HEIGHT (both the Y drop and the Z lean) so the whole shape
## scales cleanly if PONYTAIL_HEIGHT itself changes later. P2 sits past the
## midpoint leaning the OPPOSITE (forward) direction from P1 -- that sign
## flip is what actually creates the S's own inflection, not just a single
## one-sided bow.
##
## Per direct correction ("extend more towards the rear... before it starts
## to go down, to get more clearance of the head"): P1's own BACK_FRACTION
## raised well past its DROP_FRACTION (was the reverse -- mostly downward
## with only a small back lean) so the curve's initial tangent reaches
## backward first, clearing the head's own back surface, before it starts
## curving toward vertical.

const PONYTAIL_ROOT_INSET := 0.05

## LONG: "extending a bit to the sides and back then making the bottom
## much less round and extending downwards a variable length" -- bottom
## epsilon goes straight to BOTTOM_EPSILON_TARGET (no partial blend at
## all), noticeably boxier than even the buzzcut's own partial blend,
## reading as a blunt-cut end rather than a trimmed taper. length_variance
## (passed in per-call, e.g. from town_generator.gd's own per-NPC random
## pool) adds on top of LONG_BASE_DROP so every long-haired NPC isn't the
## same length.
const LONG_WIDTH_MULT := 1.15
const LONG_BACK_EXTRA := 0.03
const LONG_BASE_DROP := 0.05
## Per direct correction ("extend the front forward considerably so we get
## to actually see bangs in front of the face"): pushes the main piece's
## own front edge well past the head's own front surface -- large enough
## that once the cut below removes everything below eye height, what's
## left above the cut genuinely drapes forward over the forehead like a
## fringe, not just a subtle bulge.

const LONG_FULL_BACK_EXTRA := 0.045

const LONG_EXTRA_FULL_WIDTH_MULT := 1.32
## Per direct correction (Amanda's own hairstyle was clipping through the top
## of her head, and read as too narrow at the sides/back): TOP_EXTRA raises
## the crown several cm past the shared long-hair top edge; WIDTH_EXTRA and
## the raised BACK_EXTRA push the sides and back out a few more cm each.
## Flat additions in this project's own real-world-ish scale (0.01 = ~1cm,
## per HERO_UP_SHIFT/FLAT_TOP_BACK_SHIFT's own comments), not multipliers,
## since the request was in cm, not proportional.
const LONG_EXTRA_FULL_TOP_EXTRA := 0.05
const LONG_EXTRA_FULL_WIDTH_EXTRA := 0.03
const LONG_EXTRA_FULL_BACK_EXTRA := 0.11
## Per direct correction ("visibly showing in the front below the chin...
## a subtraction superegg offset to the front and bottom, with a smaller
## radius"): a single superegg extended far enough down to read as long
## hair is, at every latitude including the lower ones, still as wide
## front-to-back as it is at the equator -- there's no way to taper just
## the lower-front region of ONE superegg (the same longitude-vs-latitude
## limit documented on BOTTOM_EPSILON_TARGET above: SuperEgg's own
## epsilon_top/epsilon_bottom split only varies roundness by latitude
## band, never by front-vs-back). A second, smaller superegg carved out
## via real CSG subtraction (CSGCombiner3D + CSGMesh3D, OPERATION_
## SUBTRACTION) is what genuinely removes geometry from just that one
## region instead.
##
## Per a further direct correction ("move the clipping shape upwards so
## its top is just above the top of the eyes"): the cut's own Y position
## is solved directly from FigureEyes.top_y() -- this project's actual eye
## geometry, not a guessed fraction -- plus a small margin, rather than a
## fraction below the main piece's own center. Everything ABOVE the cut
## (crown down to just above the eyes) stays the full, considerably-
## forward-extended main piece -- the visible bangs -- and everything at
## or below eye height gets the front carved away instead.
const LONG_CUT_XZ_MULT := 0.9  # smaller than the main piece's own width/depth, per direct instruction
# Raised another 5 cm (0.02 -> 0.07). Raising the cut's top raises where
# the bangs get clipped, so less of the forward-extended main piece stays
# visible above it.
const LONG_CUT_TOP_MARGIN := 0.07  # cut's own top sits this far above FigureEyes.top_y()
## The negative egg extends a full matching half-height below the positive
## hair's bottom. In other words, the positive bottom crosses the cut at
## the cut egg's equator, where its X/Z footprint is widest; all of the
## cut egg's narrowing lower curve remains below the visible hair. This is
## derived from the length-variance-inclusive bottom rather than a fixed
## margin, so longer hair automatically receives a proportionally deeper
## subtractor.
const LONG_CUT_Z_FRACTION := 0.55  # how far in front of the main piece's own center

## HERO: started as the same shape/roundness/epsilon treatment as the
## buzzcut, just repositioned -- "raise it up one cm" is a pure
## translation (both top AND bottom edges shift together, same technique
## FLAT_TOP_BACK_SHIFT uses for its own translate-not-resize move), while
## "extend the front forward one cm" only touches the front edge (a
## resize, growing the piece forward without dragging the back along),
## matching how every earlier single-edge cm correction on the base
## buzzcut worked. Per two further direct corrections: raised again
## (0.01 -> 0.02 total), and made "slightly less round" than the shared
## buzzcut via HERO_EPSILON_BOOST, added to top_epsilon before it's used
## both directly (crown) and as the lerp base for the bottom blend, so the
## whole piece goes uniformly a bit boxier rather than just one region.
