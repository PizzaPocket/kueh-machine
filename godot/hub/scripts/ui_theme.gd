extends RefCounted

## Central design-system tokens for every UI surface in the game (Hud,
## DialogUI, ShopUI, InventoryUI) -- one shared Theme resource so visual
## language (colors, type scale, spacing, panel/button style) lives in one
## place instead of being re-decided ad hoc per script, the way hud.gd
## originally did with scattered per-node add_theme_*_override calls.
##
## Palette: dark neutral panels plus Blorbus brain-pink psychic goo for
## Inventory and actionable controls, chosen to read clearly over an outdoor
## 3D scene. All text/background pairs
## below are computed against the real WCAG relative-luminance formula
## (using BG_PANEL as an opaque color, i.e. the best case for a translucent
## panel -- see BG_PANEL's own alpha note) and clear the AA normal-text
## threshold (4.5:1) with real margin:
##   TEXT_PRIMARY on BG_PANEL     = 14.27:1
##   TEXT_SECONDARY on BG_PANEL   =  8.75:1
##   ACCENT_GREEN on BG_PANEL     =  8.67:1
##   ACCENT_RED on BG_PANEL       =  5.64:1
## Against a worst-case pure-white scene after real alpha compositing:
##   TEXT_PRIMARY on BLORBUS_PANEL = 8.21:1
##   TEXT_SECONDARY on BLORBUS_PANEL = 5.04:1
##   TEXT_PRIMARY on BUTTON_BG    = 8.66:1
##   TEXT_PRIMARY on BUTTON_BG_HOVER = 6.57:1
## Font size alone can't guarantee AA against an arbitrary, moving 3D
## background behind unbacked text -- every piece of UI text in this game
## must sit on one of these panel colors (see UIKit.backed_readout), not
## float bare over the viewport the way hud.gd's labels originally did.
##
## See DESIGN.md-in-code below (the "design language" section at the
## bottom of this file) for the broader conventions every UI surface in
## this project should follow, not just these color/spacing tokens.

# This trades away more of the contrast margin documented above against a

# an opaque panel), but TEXT_PRIMARY's own margin (14:1 against solid
# BG_PANEL) leaves real headroom even with real blend-through.

## ---- Design language ----------------------------------------------
## Conventions every UI surface in this project (Hud, DialogUI, ShopUI,
## InventoryUI, and any future one) should follow. Build through UITheme/
## UIKit rather than hand-rolled Control.new() + ad hoc styling; if a
## genuinely new pattern is needed, add it here/to UIKit (not inline in
## the calling script) so it stays reusable and this list stays current.
##
## Every FONT_*/SPACE_* token, plus BUTTON_MIN_HEIGHT/PANEL_CORNER_RADIUS/
## BUTTON_CORNER_RADIUS and the border widths/shadow size hardcoded around
## this file, was scaled up 1.5x in one pass per direct instruction that the
## whole UI read as too small on a real screen. Any UI surface that reads
## its sizes through these tokens (which is the whole point of building
## through UITheme/UIKit rather than ad hoc styling -- see above) picked
## this up automatically; a handful of surfaces with their own hardcoded
## pixel constants (InventoryUI's SLOT_SIZE/BLORB_PORTRAIT_SIZE, DialogUI's
## panel width, Hud's readout widths) needed their own matching 1.5x update
## alongside this file's. Keep
## that relationship in mind for any *new* hardcoded pixel constant: prefer
## expressing it in terms of an existing token (see UIKit.direction_hint()'s
## icon_size := UITheme.FONT_BODY * 1.5 for the pattern) so a future
## whole-UI rescale doesn't need to go hunt it down by hand again.
##
## 1. Panels (and chips/badges/inventory slots -- anything that's a
##    passive background rather than an action the player takes) are
##    translucent, not heavily opaque, and carry no border stroke --
##    BG_PANEL's alpha and the shadow-only depth cue in _panel_stylebox()
##    are the reference; chip_stylebox()/slot_stylebox() reuse BG_PANEL
##    directly so every passive surface in the game matches. Buttons that
##    are genuinely actions the player clicks (dialogue/purchase choices,
##    not an inventory slot that happens to be a Button node for its own
##    reasons) keep a border: they need edge definition for click
##    affordance, which a passive background doesn't. That border is
##    BUTTON_BORDER (a white outline) over translucent Blorbus-pink goo,
##    not a painted-wood pairing. Keyboard/controller focus adds the separate
##    outside white ring from rule 13, while active/selected state uses fill
##    density and border weight so the signals remain distinguishable.
## 2. Never anchor a top-level, dynamically-sized Control with
##    set_anchors_and_offsets_preset(..., PRESET_MODE_KEEP_SIZE, ...) --
##    it snapshots the control's *current* size to compute offsets, and a
##    freshly-built control hasn't been through a layout pass yet (reads
##    as zero-size), which has silently mis-anchored several things this
##    way already. Use UIKit.anchor_to_edge() instead -- it's correct
##    regardless of when layout actually happens.
## 3. Any Label that must stay on one line inside a flexible row (next to
##    other controls in an HBoxContainer, not a standalone block of text)
##    needs explicit non-wrap protection: UIKit.inline_caption() or
##    UIKit.stat_badge(), not the default caption_label()/body_label().
##    caption_label()'s autowrap is correct for text of unpredictable
##    length (item descriptions) but a cramped row can squeeze a wrapping
##    label down to the point where it renders one character per line --
##    confirmed in both header readouts and short inline status copy.
## 4. Icon-style dismiss controls (closing a window-style modal) use a
##    small drawn icon (UIKit.close_button()), not a Unicode glyph
##    standing in for one. Text buttons (UIKit.button()) are for genuine
##    CTAs, not window chrome or dialogue responses (see rule 16).
## 5. A passive HUD readout whose info is also available on demand
##    elsewhere (the Tokoins count: also visible in ShopUI/InventoryUI)
##    fades in briefly on a relevant change and back out, rather than
##    staying permanently on screen as chrome.
## 6. Every UI shape in the game -- panel, button, chip, inventory slot,
##    dialog box, shop row, even a thin section divider -- is a superellipse
##    ("squircle"), never a plain rectangle or a circular-arc rounded
##    rectangle. This applies project-wide, not just to the four stylebox
##    functions below: SuperellipseStyleBox.boundary_points() is the one
##    corner-geometry function in the game (see that file), and anything
##    that isn't a StyleBox but still needs the shape -- UIKit.Divider is
##    the existing example -- calls it directly rather than falling back to
##    a ColorRect/Panel or hand-rolling its own rounding. StyleBoxFlat's
##    corner_radius never substitutes for this. SUPERELLIPSE_EXPONENT is
##    shared by every instance so the whole game reads as one consistent
##    shape language -- don't pass a bespoke exponent per surface. A new
##    background or bar needs a *radius* choice (how much of the corner
##    curves), not a decision about whether to use the shape at all. That
##    radius should default to corner_ratio (SUPERELLIPSE_RATIO), not a bare
##    fixed pixel corner_radius -- a fixed radius sized for one surface
##    reads as basically square on anything meaningfully bigger (confirmed:
##    the original 6-8px radius was invisible on a 168x152 inventory slot).
##    corner_radius still matters as the cap that keeps a huge panel from
##    rounding itself into a blob; chip_stylebox() is the one deliberate
##    exception (no ratio, always a full pill via corner_radius=999).
## 7. An item's on-screen representation (an inventory slot, shop row, or
##    elemental-gem socket) is a cached photograph of the same procedural 3D
##    geometry used in the world, never an icon or color swatch standing in
##    for it. Portrait stages reserve their final size but remain empty until
##    the real render resolves, so loading never flashes a false substitute.
## 8. An active guidance affordance (UIKit.direction_hint() -- the rotating
##    arrow pointing toward the nearest not-yet-partied wild blorb) is
##    distinct from a passive readout (rule 5 above): it stays on screen
##    for as long as there's somewhere it can usefully point, rather than
##    flashing briefly on a value change, since the player is meant to
##    actually orient by it while exploring, not just glance at a status
##    update. Still wrapped in the same translucent chip_stylebox() pill
##    every compact HUD badge uses, for the same legibility-over-the-3D-
##    scene reason.
## 9. A view switch inside one modal panel (InventoryUI's Items/Blorbs tabs)
##    is two ordinary UIKit.tab_button()s in a row, not Godot's built-in
##    TabContainer -- keeps the same hand-built superellipse/theme language
##    as everything else instead of pulling in that control's own separate
##    look. The active tab is marked by tab_button_stylebox()'s heavier border
##    (rule 1's border-for-interactive-affordance convention, reused rather
##    than inventing a new "selected" treatment), and switching swaps which
##    content container is visible rather than rebuilding the panel.
## 10. A full-panel modal (ShopUI, InventoryUI) is sized off the viewport
##     with a fixed pixel margin (set_anchors_preset(PRESET_FULL_RECT) plus
##     equal offset_left/right/top/bottom, ShopUI's own 100/100/70/70), not
##     UIKit.anchor_to_edge()'s shrink-to-content sizing -- that sizing is
##     right for a compact HUD readout or a chip, but a full task surface
##     needs a size that holds steady regardless of which internal view
##     (tab, list state) happens to be showing, with real room budgeted for
##     future sections rather than a box that re-fits itself every time
##     content changes. Content that can outgrow a fixed height (an item
##     grid, a party list, a buy/sell column) sits inside its own
##     ScrollContainer with size_flags_vertical = SIZE_EXPAND_FILL, so it's
##     the inner list that scrolls, never the panel that grows.
## 11. A game-data value the player should be able to compare at a glance
##     against its own max (a blorb's stat) is a proportional meter bar
##     (UIKit.stat_meter()), not a bare number in a stat_badge() pill --
##     rule 7's "resembles the real thing" logic extended to numbers: a
##     meter shows relative magnitude the way a badge's digits can't
##     without being read and compared one at a time. Depletable resources
##     add current/max copy and a quiet full-capacity track; fixed comparison
##     stats retain only their proportional foreground datum.
## 12. No explanatory prompt text in any UI surface -- per direct
##     instruction, a panel doesn't get an instructional sentence at its
##     top explaining how to use it (InventoryUI's Blorbs tab once had "Your
##     party. Click a blorb, then click a body part on the right to equip
##     it..."; removed, along with the Items tab's own equivalent). The UI
##     itself has to read clearly enough on its own -- affordance (a real
##     Button with hover/pressed states, per rule 1) instead of a caption
##     explaining what to click. This doesn't cover every caption_label() in
##     the game: a genuine empty-state message ("No blorbs in your party
##     yet.", ShopUI's "Nothing to sell.") is reporting actual current
##     state, not teaching operation, and stays. Keyboard/controller prompts
##     do not appear inside menus; focus, placement, and consistent controls
##     communicate operation without device-specific instructional copy. The
##     line to hold is "teaches how to use this screen" vs. "reports what's
##     actually going on right now" -- only the former is what this rule
##     removes.
## 13. Keyboard/controller focus is a white squircle ring consistently
##     offset outside the focused control. It never replaces the control's
##     selected/active surface, so focus and selection remain distinguishable.
##     An open modal must always retain a valid focus owner after selection,
##     deselection, list rebuilding, removal, or tab changes.
## 14. Blorbus is the diegetic owner of Inventory: its modal uses his
##     translucent brain-pink skin with an especially soft, curving
##     silhouette and no decorative stroke or shadow. Genuine CTA buttons
##     across every surface use the same psychic-goo material family, while
##     passive panels and inventory sockets retain their quieter roles.
## 15. World interaction prompts name the available action and object only
##     ("Talk", "Pick up orange"). They never repeat a keyboard/controller
##     binding; proximity and placement already communicate that they are
##     actionable, and bindings may differ by input device.
## 16. Dialog choices are the player's spoken lines, not CTA buttons. They
##     live in a separate bottom-right response panel, stack vertically with
##     right-aligned text, and use a drawn left-pointing arrow in a permanently
##     reserved right margin as their sole selection marker. Focus never
##     changes the text column's width or alignment. While present, they own
##     movement and action input through UIState like every other modal.
## 17. The Blorb paper doll navigates spatially, never by an arbitrary slot
##     cycle. White is focus; psychic pink exclusively means a Blorb selected
##     for assignment. Committing a portrait transfers focus to its assigned
##     limb (or Head when unassigned). A body part is bright only while the
##     doll owns focus; X on the same limb and pointer misses are non-destructive.
##     Dimmed pieces retain their element hue at reduced value with emission
##     suppressed. The limb label exists only while a body part owns focus.
##     Removal is a conditional middle-right node in the doll's spatial
##     navigation, targeting only the currently selected, assigned Blorb—never
##     an incidental consequence of selecting a piece or missing the figure.
## 18. Blorb identity uses a permanent, passive elemental-gem socket rather
##     than a type badge. An empty socket means Normal; Blorbus's empty socket
##     is his inherent Psychic exception. Blank names fall back to lowercase
##     elemental names and Blorbus's true name is fixed. Custom-name data
##     remains available, but names are passive labels until editing receives
##     a dedicated interaction flow.
## 19. Distinct information and controls use SPACE_SM as their minimum visual
##     separation. SPACE_XS is reserved for details that form one tight
##     composite, never as the default gap between independent elements.
## 20. A HUD readout that's just an existing composite control (e.g.
##     UIKit.stat_meter()) needing a background wraps it in
##     UIKit.backed_control() rather than a bespoke PanelContainer built
##     inline -- the player HP readout (Hud) is the reference: same panel
##     styling as backed_readout()/tokoin_badge(), arbitrary child instead
##     of a fixed Label/icon+Label layout.


## An inset, recessed-looking cell for an inventory grid slot -- darker
## than the surrounding panel (like a socket something sits in) rather than
## a raised button, so an *empty* slot doesn't read as an inviting,
## clickable control the way the shared Button stylebox would. No border,
## matching the panel's own stroke-free treatment -- the darker fill alone
## reads as recessed against the lighter panel behind it.
